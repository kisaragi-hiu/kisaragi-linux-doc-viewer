* Markserv
Serving Markdown as HTML
(also `readme.js` being rendered by GitHub in the interface is funny)

* Bun: Stream a file as an HTTP Response with Bun
https://bun.sh/guides/http/stream-file

Serving a file directly:

#+begin_src js
// static file server
Bun.serve({
  async fetch(req) {
    // Getting the URL from the request
    const url = new URL(req.url)
    // Getting the target file name from the URL
    const path = url.pathname;
    // A Bun.file can be made into a Response directly and Bun knows
    // what to do
    return new Response(Bun.file(path));
  },
});
#+end_src

If we want to modify it (say to add a visual header) it might be more complicated.

** Why Bun

I'd like to not have to worry about ESM / CJS, thanks. Also Bun.serve's nice.

* Sakura.css

I use it as less ugly defaults.
